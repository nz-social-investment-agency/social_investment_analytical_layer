TITLE: MOE_ece_events

DESCRIPTION: Create ECE event table in SIAL format.
This table gives the ECE type and the hours spent in ECE by each child enrolling for the programme.
Event_type gives the ECE type that the child attended. In case of students who did not enroll for ECE, 
the hours spent would be null or 0 and the ECE event_type_2 would be 'False'. Cases with no information 
available are listed with a status of 'Unknown'. Event_type_3 would give the number of hours spent in a
particular kind of ECE.
					
The costs for the event is not available at the moment.
