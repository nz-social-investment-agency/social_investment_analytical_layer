TITLE: IRD_income_events

DESCRIPTION: Create IRD income event table in SIAL format. The code fetches all known sources of taxable 
	income and deductions at the individual level, except for MSD T1 and T2 related benefits (which can be
	obtained from the respective SIAL tables). This table also has the income tax component and Student 
	loan related income, deductions and student allowances, pensions.

INPUT:  data.income_tax_yr
		ir_clean.ird_ems
		wff_clean.lvl_two_both_primary
		&idi_refresh..sla_clean.MSD_borrowing
		sla_clean.ird_amt_by_trn_type

OUTPUT: [&schema.].SIAL_IRD_income_events

DEPENDENCIES: 
NA

NOTES: 
	1. See SIAL data dictionary for business rules applied.
	2. This is a very processing intensive piece of code, and takes around 5 minutes
		to start fetching rows.
	3. Keep in mind that this query retrieves a huge number of rows, in the order of
		billions. Judicious use of this query is strongly recommended.

AUTHOR: V Benny, adapted from Marc De Boer's SAS code for income dataset creation

HISTORY: 
13 Apr 2018 v3  Vinay Benny		Removed the absolute value around cost column for income_tax_yr table
								This is to account for the potential negative values for S00 and P00.
08 Jul 2017	v2	Vinay Benny		Re-adapted based on Marc De Boer's SAS code for better detail
01 Oct 2016	v1	Vinay Benny		First version based on &idi_refresh..data.income_cal_yr
PNH - June 2019 - Views now have to be created in the IDI_UserCode Schema in the IDI
August 2019 - Added a select statement to log if user does not have access to under lying IDI tables
